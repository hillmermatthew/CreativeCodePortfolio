# "Planets" Screensaver/Game

This project was originally a space-themed "screensaver" consisting of colorful falling 3D "Planet" spheres on a black background, but I later adapted the project into a simple game in which you control a spaceship and try to avoid cube obstacles using the arrow keys. 

You can try it out [here](https://editor.p5js.org/hillmermatthew/present/ehsAg7HvQ), or you can play around with the code itself by copying the javascript [source code](planets.js) into a [p5.js editor](http://editor.p5js.org).


## 12/12 Final Portfolio Update
Like I mentioned above, I transformed the original screensaver concept into a simple video game, complete with a score counter and everything.  Additionally, I noticed that the planets took a few seconds to populate in the background, so I created a simple "loading" graphic that plays briefly at the start.  Overall, I'm really happy with how this one turned out.
