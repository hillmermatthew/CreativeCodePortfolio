# Bot Project

This bot, [@LigmaBot](https://twitter.com/LigmaBot), is meant to create and share random Ligma Jokes composed of random nouns and verbs placed into one of multiple preset templates.

The bot is hosted at [Cheap Bots Done Quick](https://cheapbotsdonequick.com), so the code is a [Tracery](http://www.tracery.io/) grammar.

## 12/12 Final Portfolio Additions
For my final portfolio revision, I added a few new words and templates to the bot so the tweets have a bit more variety.  One noticable example of a template addition is that the bot can now include emojis in the tweets.  I was already pretty happy with this project, but I think these additions are good ones that make it even better.
